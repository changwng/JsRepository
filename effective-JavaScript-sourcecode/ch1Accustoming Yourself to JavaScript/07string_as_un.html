<p>Because each code point in a UTF-16 encoding may require either one or two 16-byte code units, UTF-16 is a <font style="font-size:24px; color:red">variable-length </font> encoding: The size in memory of a string of length n varies based on the particular code points in the string. Moreover, finding the nth code point of a string is no longer a constant-time operation: It generally requires searching from the beginning of the string</p>

<p>JavaScript strings consist of 16-bit code units, not Unicode code points.
Unicode code points 216 and above are represented in JavaScript by two code units, known as a surrogate pair.
Surrogate pairs throw off string element counts, affecting length, charAt, charCodeAt, and regular expression patterns such as “.”.
Use third-party libraries for writing code point-aware string manipulation.
Whenever you are using a library that works with strings, consult the documentation to see how it handles the full range of code points.。</p>
