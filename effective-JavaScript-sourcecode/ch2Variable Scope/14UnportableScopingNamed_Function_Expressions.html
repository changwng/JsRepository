<p>
Use named function expressions to improve stack traces in Error
objects and debuggers.
✦ Beware of pollution of function expression scope with Object
.prototype in ES3 and buggy JavaScript environments.
✦ Beware of hoisting and duplicate allocation of named function 
expressions in buggy JavaScript environments.
✦ Consider avoiding named function expressions or removing them 
before shipping.
✦ If you are shipping in properly implemented ES5 environments, 
you’ve got nothing to worry about.
