<p>
 Understand the difference between binding and assignment.
✦ Closures capture their outer variables by reference, not by value.
✦ Use immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs) to create local 
scopes.
✦ Be aware of the cases where wrapping a block in an IIFE can change 
its behavior.
