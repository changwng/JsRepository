<p>
Always use a for loop rather than a for...in loop for iterating over 
the indexed properties of an array

<br/> 
Consider storing the length property of an array in a local variable 
before a loop to avoid recomputing the property lookup
<br/>
This approach ensures that you have integer indices when you need 
them and array element values when you need them, and that you 
never confuse the two or trigger unexpected coercions to strings. 
Moreover, it ensures that the iteration occurs in the proper order 
and does not accidentally include noninteger properties stored on the 
array object or in its prototype chain.
