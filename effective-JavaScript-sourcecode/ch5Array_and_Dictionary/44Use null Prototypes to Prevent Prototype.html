<p>
In ES5, use Object.create(null) to create prototype-free empty 
objects that are less susceptible to pollution.
<hr/>
✦ In older environments, consider using { __proto__: null }.
<hr/>
✦ But beware that __proto__ is neither standard nor entirely portable 
and may be removed in future JavaScript environments.
<hr/>
✦ Never use the name "__proto__" as a dictionary key since some 
environments treat this property specially.
